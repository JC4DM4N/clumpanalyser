"""
Takes the clump information from the final disc dump and iterates backward until this
    clump can no longer be located (i.e. when the clump has first formed.)

We will compare 3 things for each clump
i- 50% of the members of the previous clumps are present in the new clump
ii- The new clump has a COM in the location we expect it to be
(iii- The most bound particle from the previous clump is still present)
If the first two conditions are satisfied, we have located the clump in the previous
    dump and can keep moving backward.
If a clump cannot be located in the previous (10) dumps to where it was last found, 
    then this clump no longer exists and we have found its origin.
